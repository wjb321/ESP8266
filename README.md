      while when connecting with warship board, it does not work.   
2.!!! the reference book, can follow from P26, it finally works with the 1 status.

1,remember EN is no need to be connected(try to unplug it when syn does no work when downloading the firmware
2,when in working mode, should shortly plug in RST in GND so esp8266 will start working
